# Sales Analysis Dashboard | Power BI

**End-to-End Business Intelligence Project**

## Executive Summary

This project delivers an interactive **sales intelligence dashboard** built in Power BI to help business stakeholders **track revenue, profitability, and sales behavior** across time, geography, and product hierarchy.

The focus is not just visualization, but **data modeling, DAX logic, and insight generation** that supports real business decisions.

---

## Business Problem

Sales leaders often struggle to answer:

* Which products drive revenue vs. profit?
* Which regions sell more but underperform on margins?
* How does sales performance change over time?

This dashboard solves these questions through **structured data modeling and dynamic analysis**, enabling stakeholders to move from raw data to actionable insights.

---

## Data Preparation & Modeling

* Cleaned and transformed raw sales data using **Power Query**
* Integrated multiple tables using appropriate **join strategies**
* Designed a **star-schema-style data model** with fact and dimension tables
* Configured relationships with correct **cardinality and filter direction**
* Used **active and inactive relationships** to support advanced slicer behavior
* Validated data consistency after modeling

> **Key learning:** Relationship management and filter context had the biggest impact on analytical accuracy.

## KPIs & DAX Measures

Developed reusable, context-aware DAX measures including:

* Total Sales
* Total Profit
* Quantity Sold
* Profit Margin
* Month-over-Month and Year-over-Year trends

Key DAX concepts applied:

* `CALCULATE`
* Filter context manipulation
* Time-intelligence patterns
* Dynamic evaluation driven by slicers

---

## Dashboard Capabilities

* Interactive slicers for **Date, Region, Category, and Sub-Category**
* Cross-filtering across all visuals
* Drill-down analysis for deeper exploration
* KPI cards that update dynamically with user selections
* Clean layout designed for **executive-level consumption**

---

## Key Business Insights

* A small set of product categories contributes disproportionately to total revenue
* Certain regions show **high sales volume but weak profitability**, indicating pricing or cost issues
* Clear **seasonality trends** influence monthly sales performance
* Profit behavior varies significantly even when revenue appears stable

These insights enable **pricing strategy review, regional optimization, and demand planning**.
